· Multisets
[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/description/)
§ Use a multiset for this one. You can also solve it without using one. How? Try to solve it both ways. How do the two solutions compare?

§ This one has a few “clever” solutions but feel free to use a simple multiset solution.
[https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-atoms/](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-atoms/description/)

§ This one is more difficult than the average interview question but it is good exercise! You will need to build a simple parser in addition to using a multiset.

## Resources

· Python Resources

o [Tutorial on dictionaries in Python (hash maps)](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-dictionary-tutorial)

o [Bonus: Learn how and when to use defaultdict in Python to speed up your coding](https://www.accelebrate.com/blog/using-defaultdict-python/)

o [Tutorial on sets in Python (hash sets)](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/sets-in-python)

o [Multisets in Python: The collections.Counter class](https://pymotw.com/2/collections/counter.html)

§ This is a very powerful class to know how to use. Some interview problems can be solved in only a few lines of code if you know how to use this class. Make sure you know how it works and that you could implement an equivalent class if needed. A good exercise would be to implement your own Counter class that imitates collections.Counter using a dictionary as the underlying structure.

· Java Resources

o [HashMap in Java](https://www.callicoder.com/java-hashmap/)

o [HashSet in Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-hashset)

o Multisets: Unfortunately Java does not come with a multiset class. You will have to use a HashMap<T, Integer> and manually implement any of the multiset operations you need. (For real-world applications, you can use Google's Guava library which comes with a [multiset class](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/16.0/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/Multiset.html) but I do not recommend using this for coding interviews as interviewers are likely to be unfamiliar with it, and you are generally expected to only use standard language features and libraries only.)
